## Dataset
The dataset contains daily expense records including:
- Date
- Spending category
- Amount spent
- Payment mode

## Key Insights
- Food expenses occur most frequently, indicating regular daily spending.
- Shopping contributes the largest share of total expenditure (~53%), driven by a few high-value transactions.
- Spending spikes are primarily caused by shopping days.
- Budget optimization can be achieved by reducing the frequency of shopping-related purchases rather than cutting essential expenses.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Google Colab

### Dashboard Summary
- Total spending: ₹3589 out of a ₹5000 budget, indicating budget compliance.
- Shopping dominates overall expenditure, contributing ₹1900 of total spend.
- Average daily spending is approximately ₹598, representing the daily burn rate.
- Shopping is identified as the primary financial risk due to its disproportionate contribution.

 ## Conclusion
