# Personal Expense Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes personal spending data to identify major cost drivers, spending patterns, and budgeting insights.

## Dataset
The dataset contains daily expense records including:
- Date
- Spending category
- Amount spent
- Payment mode

## Key Insights
- Food expenses occur most frequently, indicating regular daily spending.
- Shopping contributes the largest share of total expenditure (~53%), driven by a few high-value transactions.
- Spending spikes are primarily caused by shopping days.
- Budget optimization can be achieved by reducing the frequency of shopping-related purchases rather than cutting essential expenses.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Conclusion
The analysis shows that while daily expenses are mostly small, discretionary spending dominates overall costs. Controlling shopping frequency can significantly improve budgeting.
